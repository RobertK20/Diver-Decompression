WIP Java scuba diver decompression planner. Decompression library simulates tissue loading and predicts ascent profile and no decompression limit using Buhlmann ZHL-16C GF algorithm.

ZHL-16C half-times, A and B values for both inert gases are contained in src/DecoLib/tissues/compartments_init.java.
